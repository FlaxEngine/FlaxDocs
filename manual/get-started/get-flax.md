To install Flax use the **Add Version** button to select the Engine version and target installation destination folder. Here is where you can pick a target platform to install the packages required to build and deploy your game for a given platform. Finally, you can press the **Install** button to download the Flax binaries.

By using the *Version* dropdown menu you can pick the engine version to install. By default it selects the latest version but you can change it to get an older engine version (eg. that your team is using). Also, it allows you to download and use daily builds from Github master branch (named `master branch (daily)`). With this option, you can download updates every day and enjoy frequent features and bug fixes.
