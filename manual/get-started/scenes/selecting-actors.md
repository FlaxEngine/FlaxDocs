To select an object simply click on it with the **left mouse button** in an *Editor* window. Clicking on an actor will deselect any currently selected actors and select the new one instead. If you hold down the **Ctrl** key while you click on a new (unselected) object, the new object is added to the selection. If you hold down the **Ctrl** key while clicking on an already selected object, the object is removed from the selection.

## Scene tree selection

You can also use a *Scene* window that shows the hierarchy of the scene with a tree view control. Each node represents an actor so you can **left-click** to select it. If you press the **Ctrl** key while selecting you will add or remove the actor from the selection. Additionaly if you hold **Shift** key you will select range of actors at once.
