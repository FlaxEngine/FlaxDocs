# Game Settings

**Game Settings** infrastructure is used to prepare the Flax options for the built game.
By using game settings you can set the initial game scene, link your plugin runtime options or more.
This section covers the main concept of game settings and documents the related asset types.

## Root asset

In order to provide more universal design and unify the [project's structure](../../get-started/project-structure.md), the game settings asset is **always located** in `Content/GameSettings.json`. This file is in json format and contains the basic game description (product name, company, etc.) and references other assets (time settings, layers and tags, etc.).
Example game settings file can be found [here](https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxSamples/blob/master/BasicTemplate/Content/GameSettings.json). By default all Flax samples and templates contain a proper game settings to use.

## Creating settings

![New Settings](../../physics/media/new-settings.png)

You can use the *Content* window to create new settings. Simply right-click in the Content folder and select option **New -> Settings**, specify its name and press *Enter*. Then select the new asset type. Game settings asset or any other settings asset is normal Json resource so you can rename/move/edit them like other asset types. It's highly recommended to use a [version control](../../get-started/version-control.md) system for settings as they are text files and should be versioned when working in a team.

## Accessing settings at runtime

Example code to access game settings data in game code.

# [C#](#tab/code-csharp)
```cs
using FlaxEditor.Content.Settings;
using FlaxEngine;

public class TestSettingsUsage : Script
{
    public override void OnEnable()
    {
        var gameSettings = GameSettings.Load();
        Debug.Log("Game name: " + gameSettings.ProductName);
        var timeSettings = GameSettings.Load<TimeSettings>();
        Debug.Log("Draw FPS from settings: " + timeSettings.DrawFPS);
    }
}
```
# [C++](#tab/code-cpp)
```cpp
#include "Engine/Core/Log.h"
#include "Engine/Core/Config/GameSettings.h"
#include "Engine/Core/Config/TimeSettings.h"
#include "Engine/Scripting/Script.h"

class GAME_API TestSettingsUsage : public Script
{
DECLARE_SCRIPTING_TYPE(TestSettingsUsage);
public:
    void OnEnable() override
    {
        const auto gameSettings = GameSettings::Get();
        LOG(Info, "Game name: {0}", gameSettings->ProductName);
        const auto timeSettings = TimeSettings::Get();
        LOG(Info, "Draw FPS from settings: {0}", timeSettings->DrawFPS);
    }
};
```
