# Cube Textures

![Cube Textures](media/cube-textures.jpg)

**Cube Texture** is a binary asset that contains a set of 6 images combined together into a cube map. Cube textures are used for skyboxes, reflection probes and 360-degree scene captures.

Flax supports importing cubemaps from `.dds` files. You can also bind them to materials and sample in the shaders.
