# Coroutines

*How often do you fing yourself creating timers? Now make a sequence of them!*

Coroutines are programs executed alongside your main program. They are used to execute **asynchronous single-threaded** actions. They provide a handy interface for algorithms that require being **suspended and resumed**.

Coroutines can make your program be more maintainable and potentialy run faster.
