## How to create C# script?

C# scripting is enabled by default in [Flax Project modules](../../editor/flax-build/index.md), so C# scripts can be added without any further setup. In the *Content Window*, go to your project's module source folder `Source/<module_name>` and *right-click* to add **C# Script** in the module.
